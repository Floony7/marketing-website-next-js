Most WordPress themes aren't 100% optimized for SEO partly because they don't include caching. Slow page loads is one of the absolutely most crucial factors influencing your ranking. It has never been more important to ensure your site loads quickly, considering how many people will be accessing your site on a mobile devicce and not on broadband WiFi.

Caching the previously loaded resources reduces the number of http requests and therefore improves site performance.

Smush simply optimizes your images so that they look sharp but at lower image file sizes. A whole branch of web development involves ensuring images are optimal for the deivce size. You won't have to worry about that if you use Smush because that will all be done for you.

### Yoast SEO

Yoast really is the Swiss Army knife of WordPRess plugins. It performs on-page optimization by ensuring there are title tags and keywords behind the scenes in the HTML. It has an SEO analysis feature that looks over your content and gives you tips on how to improve SEO.

It can create site maps too, but this is now less important considering WordPress 5.5 introduced site maps as an out of the box feature.

If it influences SEO, chances are the Yoast plugin will provide a way to optimize it. This is important because Google looks at everything your site is doing and ranks it accordingly.
